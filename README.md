# Online Tower of Hanoi

Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle introduced to the West by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883.

The puzzle begins with the disks stacked on one rod in order of decreasing size. The goal is to move the entire stack to the last rod moving one disk at a time and no disk can be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.

The minimal number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle is (2^n) − 1, where n is the number of disks.
